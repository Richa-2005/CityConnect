# CityConnect – Unified Civic Interaction & Mobility Platform

CityConnect is a GovTech-focused web platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government authorities by centralizing civic issue reporting, public project tracking, urban mobility planning, and emergency alerts into a single, transparent system.

This repository contains the **Round 2 prototype** developed for the ACM-W NariYukti TechHack, with a working frontend demonstration customized for **Hubballi city**.

## 🚩 Problem Overview

Modern Indian cities face fragmented digital systems where:
- Civic complaints are scattered across multiple portals and often go unnoticed.
- Government projects lack transparency in timelines, locations, and public impact.
- Public transport information is confusing, unreliable, or inaccessible.
- Emergency alerts during marches, riots, or disasters are delayed or inconsistent.

This fragmentation leads to **delayed responses, safety risks, wasted resources, and reduced public trust**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design a **single, citizen-centric platform** that:
- Enables structured civic participation
- Improves governance transparency
- Enhances urban mobility
- Strengthens public safety through verified, real-time communication

---

## 🧩 Scope of the Prototype

This prototype focuses on:
- **Frontend-first implementation**
- **City-specific demonstration (Hubballi)**
- Clear system workflows for both **Citizens** and **Government Authorities**

Backend, AI, and data integrations are represented through a **realistic and scalable system architecture**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👥 Citizen Module
- File civic complaints with location, category, and description
- Upvote existing issues to highlight urgency
- View top city problems by area and category
- Track ongoing government projects with timelines and impact notes
- Plan public transport routes (fastest & cheapest)
- Receive real-time alerts for emergencies, marches, and disruptions
- Search public facilities (libraries, parks, offices)

### 🏛 Government Module
- Dashboard for complaint prioritization and status tracking
- Issue assignment to departments
- Project update editor for timelines and progress
- City-wide alert creation and targeted dissemination

---

## 🧠 Innovation & Differentiation

- Combines **governance, mobility, and safety** into a single platform
- Uses **citizen upvotes** to drive data-backed prioritization
- Designed for **AI-driven scalability** (NLP categorization, clustering, insights)
- Focuses on **transparency-first governance**
- City-specific modeling enables easy replication across cities

---

## 🏗 System Architecture (Conceptual)

- **Frontend:** React-based web interface
- **Backend (Planned):** Node.js + Express APIs
- **Database (Planned):** PostgreSQL with geospatial support
- **AI Layer (Planned):** NLP-based complaint categorization & prioritization
- **External Integrations (Planned):**
  - DigiLocker (identity verification)
  - Maps APIs (routing & geo-queries)
  - Government Open Data portals
  - Push / SMS alert services

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Prototype)

### Frontend
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

### Design & UX
- Modular component-based UI
- City-first data visualization
- Role-based flows (Citizen / Government)

## 📍 City Focus: Hubballi

The prototype uses **Hubballi city** as a reference model:
- Sample civic issues
- Sample public transport routes
- Sample government projects
- City-specific alerts

This demonstrates **real-world feasibility** and readiness for on-ground deployment.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Full backend & database integration
- AI-powered duplicate detection & severity scoring
- Real-time WebSocket-based updates
- Mobile application
- Multi-city scalability with admin-level controls
